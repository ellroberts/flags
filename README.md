245 flags Free for you to use and enjoy. These flags have been super simplified (as much as possible) to keep the SVG file sizes small. Super complex crests and textures have been re-created using simple paths.

- All vector, all in sketch
- Most colors stored as easily maintainable sketch styles
- Available to use immediately as PNG (1-3x), SVG and PDF.
